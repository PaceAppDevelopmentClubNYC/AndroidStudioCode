    This rotate.xml file is to create the animation of these dice spinning
    around after the player die has been clicked.

    android:fromDegrees="0" and android:toDegrees"360" means that we are going
    to rotate these dice all the way from zero degrees to 360 degrees or one
    complete revolution. android:duration="200" means that this rotation will
    last 200 miliseconds.And pivotX and pivotY means that the images will be
    rotated around 50% from the center x value and 50% of the distance to the
    center y value. So essentially rotated around the dead center of each image.
    50% of the distance from left to right in the x-plane and 50% of the distance
    in the y-plane from bottom to top is the point from where the rotation will
    take place.
